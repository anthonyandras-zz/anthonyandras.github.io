<h1>Anthony Andras' GitHub Page</h1>
<p>
	I am a practicing computer scientist in the Chicagoland area. My goal by 
	setting up this page is to eventually develop in into an online portfolio
	of some of my own research. I focus my research efforts on a number of 
	different things. Currently, I am most interested in diving deep into 
	the design and analysis of graph algorithms. My intention is to build
	up a knowledge base of this field that is deep enough to dive into 
	geospatial databases.
</p>
<p>
	While researching and perfecting my algorithmic capabilities is great,
	there is an element of pragmitism that comes into question when applying
	these methods to every day business scenarios. Through the theoretical 
	foundations that I gain from this research, I am able to draw upon this
	knowledge and apply them to problems that my clients face. With that said,
	there are often many mediums that are leveraged when implementing such 
	concepts:
	<ul>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>Scala</li>
		<li>Groovy</li>
	</ul>
	These are my current preferred languages for communicating my research, however
	I will always attempt to explore different languages to determine which is the 
	best tool for the job. 
</p>
<p>
	In addition, there are frameworks and utilities that play into these languages,
	ones that generally simplify our lives. While I may be stepping outside the 
	general notion of geospatial algorithms and datastores at this point, I find
	that certain framework are of particular interest to me. Some of these I have
	yet to learn or am currently learning. These include:
	<ul>
		<li>Apache Spark</li>
		<li>Apache Kafka</li>
		<li>Cassandra</li>
		<li>Spring Boot</li>
		<li>ReactiveX</li>
		<li>Angular2</li>
		<li>ReactJS</li>
	</ul>
	One will notice that there is a strong lean towards big data, parallel grids, and
	reactive based development here. These are areas that are strong interest to me.
</p>
<p>
	What lies underneath on my github was traditionally a big mish-mosh of projects
	that I have accumulated over the years. These were mostly toy applications that 
	were a result of a class or just a tangental curiosity about a particular language
	or technology. I am in the process of uprooting this and removing some of the "noise"
	from my GitHub so I can make it more focused and valuable to both me and anyone
	who chooses to read into these pages.
